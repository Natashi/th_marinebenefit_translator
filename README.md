# Touhou Marine Benefit patcher/translator

A program I made to patch and translate the Touhou fangame "東方海恵堂 ～ Marine Benefit".

### From the source code

- **You'll need:**
  - rustc (any version that works, I used 1.66.0)
- **Then do:**

    ```
    % git clone https://github.com/Natashi/th_marinebenefit_translator
    % cd th_marinebenefit_translator
    % cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

Just run the damn thing, it'll tell you how to use it.
